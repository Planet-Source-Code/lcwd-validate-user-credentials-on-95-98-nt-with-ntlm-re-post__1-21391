## Validate User Credentials on 95/98/NT with NTLM \(re\-post\)


</div>

### Description

If you need a separate logon rather than just the OS logon for your application and you are fed up with maintaining user passwords within your application, this may be suitable for you. This is a VB implementation of MSDN KB Q180548 (or http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q180/5/48.ASP). Please read the caution statement in the article before you use it.
